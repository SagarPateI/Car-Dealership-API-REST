# Car-Dealership-API-REST
The car dealership API involves designing and developing a website that allows employees to browse and keep track of vehicles in their dealership.

If you would like to test out this website: https://sagarpatei.github.io/Car-Dealership-API-REST/
But in order to test the API itself, you must download the repository and run the main.py file along with your own XAMPP server. Then import the sql database into your XAMPP server.
